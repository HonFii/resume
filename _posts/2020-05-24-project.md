### 1. Automatic identification of multi-type weld seam based on vision sensor with Silhouette-mapping

* To overcome the challenges of feature extraction derived from the weld seam diversity, we use silhouette-mapping as  intermedium for weld seam feature and introduce a multi-type weld seam automatic identification system based on vision sensor. *This research provides a solution for automaticing the extraction of features similar to weld seam by combining the intermedium and deep learning (DL)*. 
* **Index Terms:** Silhouette mapping, weld seam identifications, vision sensor, bidirectional deviation search,
convolutional neural network(CNN)

### 2. Robust identification of weld seam based on region of interest operation

* In the obtained welding image, the weld seams have two distinct features related to the workpiece, which are continuous in a single process and separated from the workpieceâ€™s gray value. To obtain robust weld coordinates, we achieve the identification of the entire weld path in a single image by DROI adaptive iteration, which is concentrated around the weld seam to reduce the interference of external noise. *This research provides a solution for the robust extraction of path features form a single image.*
* **Index Terms:** Passive vision, Noise reduction, Welding path identification, Region of interest (ROI)
